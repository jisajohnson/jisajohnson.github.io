                        Though he was once an ally of the Geo Archon Morax, erosion and conflict with humanity led him to be sealed away in The Chasm and under the Dragon-Queller in Nantianmen. Since then, he has sought to break free of his imprisonment, absorb the energy of all the ley lines of the world, and destroy everything.</p>

                        The ancient balemoon blood flows within her fate, granting her all that the dynasty once had â€” yearning, power, and curses alike.<br>
                        In her short life, she has supped of countless agonies and drunk deep of the cup of suffering, just as her ancestors once did when they imbibed poison at the rising of the dark sun.</p>
